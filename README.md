# ARCompanion
A plugin that uses a headset-mounted camera as a make-shift Augmented/Mixed Reality setup. Useful for XR streamers.

## Useful information:
- If the video device disconnects from the PC, press the J key to reload the feed.
- The background plane can be adjusted within the ARCompanion Menu to better align with your headset view.
## Configuration:
* **Selected Webcam:** The video device name to use. "eTronVideo" for the Valve Index's dual cameras.
* **Projection Distance:** Distance in metres to move the background plane.
* **Projection Scale:** Size in meters to scale the background plane.
## Camera Compatibility:
- Most webcams reconised by Windows programs should display in-game.
- Confirmed to work with the original HTC Vive's camera, but with lens distortion.
- Not tested with the Valve Index's dual cameras, though let me know if it works!
- Does *not* work with the Oculus Rift S IR camera.
