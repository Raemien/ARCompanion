# AR Companion
A plugin that uses a headset-mounted camera as a make-shift Augmented/Mixed Reality setup. Useful for XR streamers.

## Useful information:
- If the video device disconnects from the PC, press the J key to reload the feed.
- Offsets can be applied within the ARCompanion menu to better align with your headset view.
## Configuration:
* **Selected Webcam:** The video device name to use. "eTronVideo" for the Valve Index's dual cameras.
* **Projection Distance:** Distance in metres to move the background plane.
* **Projection Scale:** Size in meters to scale the background plane.
